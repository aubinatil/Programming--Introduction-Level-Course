    "The HSG World Cup for Charity, a football tournament between students' associations at HSG, has been organized by Happy Feet for the last 2 years at the University of St. Gallen. Happy Feet is a students' club which organizes Football summer camps for children close to Geneva. All the money raised through the events is given to charity.\n",
